## Project status
MVP based on the user stories is ready. Some small UI details have been left out compared to the Figma design.

**To do if I have the time for it:**
* Fix the left out UI details (like the arrow in navigation tooltip)
* Animations would be nice
* Add URQL cache exhanges so some of the queries and mutations would be more effective
* Actually do front-end test suite

## Scripts
npm run
* deploy (add and commit changes, push to github and backend to heroku)
* heroku (push backend to heroku)
